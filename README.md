This is an agent loop orchestrator. 

There are likely thousands of these out there, and thousands more coming, 
made by morons who have never studied AI seriously a day in their life, but think because they can talk to Claude Code
they can make a successful business by writing an orchestrator and talking about AI.

I wrote this by talking to Claude Code (and Codex ... and Gemini) and I'm sure it will make a successful business,
as long as I talk about AI on Hacker News (Gary: shoot me an email, I'm willing to consider your incubator)

More to the point (of course, I wouldn't disrespect you by wasting your time) ... this is for all the people who think that taking "chat with an agent" on your phone is a good UI model -- are you a fucking lemming? 
If Boris told you to jump off a cliff, would you say "Absolutely!" and hop off. Have you ever stepped back and considered that ... maybe ...
you shouldn't just accept what is given to you blindly?

You are insignificant, your ideas are inconsequential, and your actions reduce to the mean of all humanity: your life a perfectly middling affair, 
wanting in creativity, careful thinking or effort. In short, we are all dust in the wind, but you are ... dustier.

Anyways, this code (`uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/femtomc/loopfarm loopfarm` btw) gives you _loops_, an issue tracker, and a forum for agent conversation -- all rolled into one. 
It's programmable -- don't let people tell you how to use your own fucking tools. The relationship between you and your tools is an intimate one.
Most companies start from a place of disrespect: "you don't know how to use your tools ... we do." The gift of a programmable tool is the ultimate form of respect ... 
just ask your agent about it.
