# loopfarm

This is an agent loop orchestrator. There are likely thousands of these out there, and thousands more coming, 
made by morons who have never studied AI seriously a day in their life, but think because they can talk to Claude Code
they can make a successful business by writing an orchestrator and talking about AI.

You are insignificant, your ideas are inconsequential, and your actions reduce to the mean of all humanity: your life a perfectly middling affair, 
wanting in creativity, careful thinking or effort. In short, we are all dust in the wind, but you are ... dustier.

Anyways, this code (`uv tool install loopfarm` btw) gives you _loops_, an issue tracker, and a forum for agent conversation -- all rolled into one. 
It's programmable -- don't let people tell you how to use your own fucking tools. The relationship between you and your tools is an intimate one.
Most companies start from a place of disrespect: "you don't know how to use your tools ... we do." The gift of a programmable tool is the ultimate form of respect.
